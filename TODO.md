# TODO.md

Forward-looking feature/refactor ideas. Not optimizations - those live in
[OPTIMIZATIONS.md](OPTIMIZATIONS.md). This is a working backlog; entries
get deleted as they ship or stop being worth tracking.

## Deferred forward-looking ideas

### Grow the brokkr workload registry to the full candidate surface

What: `bench/` currently ports the 15 curated benches (+ `large_source`
registered against its examples/ file). The optimization backlogs name
more trackers that exist in `examples/` but have no seconds-scale
verdict port yet: the `calls/` family (`local`, `global`, `method`,
`method_cached`, `method_chain`, `vararg`, `fixedarg`, `general`,
`factory_closure` - the measurement surface for the frame-flattening
and closure-clone rewrites), `fields/polymorphic` / `same_obj_cached` /
`same_obj_write`, `tables/numeric_index` / `mixed`, `alloc/short_tables`,
`iter/ipairs`. Port with the same recipe (kernel + calibrated repeat
loop, ~100ms/call, footer 30) and register both pins (the bench/ port
as `file`, the examples/ original as `hotpath_file`).

Also open: a seconds-scale parse workload (`large_source` at a second,
larger size - which doubles as the missing second data point for the
suspected-quadratic parse candidates), and a Rust-driven snapshot bench
(OPTIMIZATIONS.md "Snapshot path" - needs harness support, not a .lua
file).

Why deferred: the registry is live with the 16 curated workloads;
porting the rest before those have proven the recipe would be
premature batch work.

Signal that would promote it: active work starting on any candidate
whose tracker is still examples/-only.

### Configurable per-category cost weights

What: let library consumers set their own cost per opcode category
(arithmetic, table_writes, function_calls, ...) rather than the
hardcoded `cost = 1` per costed op. Some embedders might want
arithmetic to cost less than allocations, or vice versa.

Sketch: `State::set_cost_weights(weights: CostWeights)` where
`CostWeights` is a struct with one `u32` field per category that the
existing `analyze_cost` already enumerates (arithmetic, negation,
table_creation, table_writes, array_elements, ...). The eval loop
multiplies by the configured weight when charging cost. Default
weights all = 1, preserving current behavior.

Why deferred: not user-requested by the current consumer; adds a
multiply per costed op (hit on the eval-loop hot path); complicates
`cost_used` interpretation across configurations. Worth doing once
there's a concrete second consumer with different cost-budget needs.

Signal that would promote it: a real embedder asking for non-uniform
weights, or a benchmarking case where the uniform-cost model
materially misrepresents the actual VM work.

### Typed `State<U>` for user-data

What: replace today's `Box<dyn Any + Send>` user-data slot with a
generic type parameter on `State`. `State<U>` carries a single `U:
Send + 'static` instead of erased `Any`, eliminating the downcast
on every access.

Sketch: `pub struct State<U = ()> { ..., user_data: U, ... }`.
`RustFunc<U> = fn(&mut State<U>) -> Result<u8>`. Stdlib functions
become generic (or stay tied to `State<()>`, with embedders writing
their own bridges). `Engine<U>` parameterized to match.

Why deferred: it infects every signature that touches `&mut State`,
including `RustFunc`, the host-callback trait, and every stdlib
function. The win over `Box<dyn Any + Send>` is one downcast per
access, which is microseconds at most. Not worth the cascading
generic churn pre-1.0 unless a concrete embedder pushes on it.

Signal that would promote it: a profile showing user-data downcasts
on the hot path, or a 1.0 API pass that lands a coherent generic
story across `State` / `Engine` / `RustFunc` / stdlib.
