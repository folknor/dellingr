## Unreleased

### Added

- Added `examples/strings/literal_find.lua` to track literal
  `string.find` performance through the examples and hotbench paths.

### Fixed

- `table.move` now handles overlapping same-table moves that shift the
  source range to the right without clobbering unread values.
- `select` now handles negative indices by counting from the end and
  rejects zero or too-negative indices instead of returning all args.
- Global `unpack` now supports the optional `i, j` range arguments,
  matching the already-supported `table.unpack` behavior.

### Performance

- `string.find` now uses the plain substring path for patterns with no
  magic characters even when `plain` is omitted. The literal path also
  avoids copying the subject and pattern before searching.

### Testing

- Split the Rust differential harness into smaller per-test buckets so
  `brokkr check` stays under its 20s per-test timeout. `diff_test.sh`
  now accepts explicit file or directory subsets while keeping its
  default full example sweep.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- `Anchor`: retain Lua values across host calls without touching globals.
  See `State::anchor*`, `push_anchor`, `call_anchor`, `release_anchor`.
  ([6837ccb](https://github.com/folknor/dellingr/commit/6837ccb))
- `Engine` / `Program`: compile Lua source once, share the immutable
  `Program(Arc<Bytecode>)` across many `State`s. `State::load(&Program)`
  loads it as a callable closure.
  ([e0bef7b](https://github.com/folknor/dellingr/commit/e0bef7b))

### Changed (breaking)

- `State::set_table_raw` argument order now matches `lua_rawset`: value
  on top of the stack, key below. Previously reversed.
  ([eeeb4ad](https://github.com/folknor/dellingr/commit/eeeb4ad))
- `State` is now `Send` (not `Sync`). `HostCallbacks: Send` and the
  user-data slot is `Box<dyn Any + Send>` - any `Rc` / `RefCell` in
  callbacks or user data must become `Arc` / `Mutex`.
  ([e0bef7b](https://github.com/folknor/dellingr/commit/e0bef7b))

### Fixed

- Method-dispatch inline caches no longer survive a `string` (or other
  builtin) rebind or a `with_restricted_env` swap. The cached library
  pointer used to bypass the new binding for the lifetime of the cached
  closure - notably, a host could pre-warm a `s:method()` call site
  outside the sandbox and the cached method would still resolve inside.

### Performance

- String-heavy workloads ~2x faster: O(1) interner, chained `..` lowers
  to one `OP_CONCAT(n)`, concat buffer pre-sized.
- Inline caches now cover `obj:method()` and `s:method()` dispatch on
  top of field reads and writes.
- Numeric integer indexing fast path on hash-storage tables
  (`tables/numeric_index` 112ms -> 73ms).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-05
